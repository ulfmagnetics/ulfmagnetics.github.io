# About

One of these days there will be enough time to tell the origin story of Ulf Magnetics, Inc. For now, I'm just going to use this blog as a place
to gather up some thoughts about stuff I'm learning, or building, or thinking about, if I'm (a) fortunate enough to find the time to learn, build, or
think about something and (b) intrepid enough to write about it afterwards.

If you need me, you can probably find me on Twitter at [@twelvetones](https://twitter.com/twelvetones).
